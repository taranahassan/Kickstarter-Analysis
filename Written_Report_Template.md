# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise, a new playwrite requires funding for her new play, **Fever**.  She needs to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, which has a budget of $10,000.  However she requires assistance in understanding how to kickstart her funding campaign to ensure a succesful turnaround.

### Purpose

This would help her to determine if there is a trend for better funding goals based on time frames.  She will also be able to quantify how succesful, failed and canceled campaigns are and if goal factors correlate to the outcome of the campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From the large data set, a separate chart was created with launch dates for only the successful, failed and canceled campaigns.  Live campaigns would not be valid as they are still active in receiving funds.  This chart helps quantify total for each outcomes and popularity in the time of year.  Total campaigns launched and ended were 1369.  Out of that 839 were successful, 493 failed and 37 were canceled.
Thus far, successful campaigns peak in May, June and July with 10%-13% higher than the other months.  Successful campaigns amount to 61% of total campaigns launched and ended.  Failed campaigns amount to 36% of total campaigns launched.  Canceled campaigns at a minimal of 3%.
A line chart included helps visualize the peak and downward trend


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
